# Ballerina

Ballerina is an open-source programming language for the cloud that makes it easier to use, combine, and create network services.

## Why Ballerina

1. **Cloud native:** Network primitives in the language make it simpler to write services and run them in the cloud.
2. **Flexibly typed:** Structural types with support for openness are used both for static typing within a program and for describing service interfaces.
3. **Data oriented:** Type-safe, declarative processing of JSON, XML, and tabular data with language-integrated queries.
4. **Graphical:** Programs have both a textual syntax and an equivalent graphical form based on sequence diagrams.
5. **Concurrent:** Easy and efficient concurrency with sequence diagrams and language-managed threads without the complexity of asynchronous functions.
6. **Reliable, maintainable:** Explicit error handling, static types, and concurrency safety, combined with a familiar, readable syntax make programs reliable and maintainable.

## This Project

This project is to learn about [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/) programming language as a preparation for the upcoming [Ballerina Coding Challenge](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/ballerina-coding-challenge/) which will be held from 22 September to 25 September.
